# Slack Integration Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up the Slack integration for the "Talk to Human" feature in your Heritagebox chatbot.

## üöÄ Quick Setup

### Step 1: Create a Slack App

2. Click "Create New App"

### Step 2: Configure Bot Permissions

2. Scroll down to "Scopes" ‚Üí "Bot Token Scopes"
3. Add these permissions:
   - `chat:write` (Send messages as the bot)

   - `groups:read` (View basic private channel info)

### Step 3: Install App to Workspace

1. Still in "OAuth & Permissions"
2. Click "Install to Workspace" at the top
3. Review permissions and click "Allow"
4. Copy the "Bot User OAuth Token" (starts with `xoxb-`)

### Step 4: Add Bot to Support Channel

1. In Slack, go to your support channel (e.g., `#customer-support`)
2. Type `/invite @Heritagebox Support Bot`
3. Or go to channel settings ‚Üí Integrations ‚Üí Add apps

### Step 5: Configure Environment Variables

Add these to your `.env` file:

```env
# Slack Integration
SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=xoxb-your-bot-token-here
SLACK_SUPPORT_CHANNEL=#customer-support
SITE_URL=https://heritagebox.com
```

### Step 6: Test the Integration

1. Go to your website
2. Open the chat widget
3. Click "Talk to Human"
4. Check your Slack channel for the notification

## üìã What Happens When Someone Clicks "Talk to Human"

### 1. Customer Experience
```
Customer clicks "Talk to Human" button
‚Üì
Shows message: "Connecting you to a human agent..."
‚Üì
Displays: "Human support has been notified. Someone will assist you shortly."
```

### 2. Slack Notification
Your support team receives a formatted message containing:

```
üö® Customer Requesting Human Support

Customer: John Doe
Email: john@example.com
Time: 1/20/2025, 1:05:23 AM
Status: Awaiting human response

Recent Conversation:
üë§ Customer: How much to digitize 200 old photos?
ü§ñ Bot: For 200 standard photos at $0.50 each, your total would be $100...
üë§ Customer: I need to speak to someone about bulk pricing

[Respond on Website] [Call Customer]
```

### 3. Team Response Options
- **Respond on Website**: Click to go to your website and respond via chat
- **Call Customer**: Take action to call the customer directly
- **Follow up via email**: Use the provided email address

## üõ†Ô∏è Advanced Configuration

### Custom Channel Names

To use a different channel, update your environment variable:
```env
SLACK_SUPPORT_CHANNEL=#sales-inquiries
# or
SLACK_SUPPORT_CHANNEL=#urgent-support
# or use channel ID
SLACK_SUPPORT_CHANNEL=C1234567890
```

### Multiple Channels by Type

You can modify the API to route to different channels based on conversation context:

```javascript
// In api/request-human.ts
let channelId = process.env.SLACK_SUPPORT_CHANNEL || '#customer-support';

// Route based on conversation content
if (conversationSummary.includes('pricing') || conversationSummary.includes('quote')) {
    channelId = '#sales-team';
} else if (conversationSummary.includes('order') || conversationSummary.includes('status')) {
    channelId = '#order-support';
}
```

### Custom Message Templates

Edit the message format in `api/request-human.ts`:

```javascript
blocks: [
    {
        type: 'section',
        text: {
            type: 'mrkdwn',
            text: 'üö® *Urgent: Customer Needs Help!*'
        }
    },
    // Add your custom blocks here
]
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### "Slack API error: channel_not_found"

**Problem**: The bot can't find the specified channel.

**Solutions**:
1. Make sure the bot is added to the channel
2. Use channel ID instead of name: `C1234567890`
3. Check channel name spelling (include # for public channels)

### "Slack API error: not_authed"

**Problem**: Invalid bot token.

**Solutions**:
1. Regenerate the bot token in Slack app settings
2. Make sure you're using the "Bot User OAuth Token", not "OAuth Access Token"
3. Verify the token starts with `xoxb-`

### "Slack API error: missing_scope"

**Problem**: Bot doesn't have required permissions.

**Solutions**:
1. Add `chat:write` permission in OAuth & Permissions
2. Reinstall the app to workspace
3. Make sure bot is added to the target channel

### Messages Not Appearing

**Checklist**:
- [ ] Bot token is correct and starts with `xoxb-`
- [ ] Bot is installed in your workspace
- [ ] Bot is added to the target channel
- [ ] Environment variables are set correctly
- [ ] Channel name/ID is correct

### Testing the Integration

You can test without the frontend by calling the API directly:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/request-human \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [
      {"sender": "user", "content": "I need help with pricing"},
      {"sender": "bot", "content": "I can help with that. What would you like to know?"},
      {"sender": "user", "content": "I want to talk to a human"}
    ],
    "customerInfo": {
      "name": "Test Customer",
      "email": "test@example.com"
    }
  }'
```

## üìä Monitoring & Analytics

### Slack Message Logs

The system logs all Slack interactions:

```javascript
// Success log
{
  "timestamp": "2025-01-20T06:05:23.123Z",
  "event": "slack_notification_sent",
  "success": true,
  "messageTs": "1642665923.123456",
  "channel": "C1234567890"
}

// Error log
{
  "timestamp": "2025-01-20T06:05:23.123Z",
  "event": "slack_notification_failed",
  "error": "channel_not_found",
  "channel": "#wrong-channel"
}
```

### Response Time Tracking

You can track how quickly your team responds by adding Slack thread replies:

```javascript
// When human responds, they can reply to the Slack thread
// This creates a full audit trail of the support interaction
```

## üöÄ Production Deployment

### Vercel Environment Variables

In your Vercel dashboard:

1. Go to Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
2. Add:
   - `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` = `xoxb-your-token-here`
   - `SLACK_SUPPORT_CHANNEL` = `#customer-support`
   - `SITE_URL` = `https://yourdomain.com`

### Security Best Practices

1. **Token Security**: Never commit Slack tokens to git
2. **Channel Permissions**: Use private channels for sensitive customer data
3. **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting to prevent spam
4. **Data Retention**: Consider Slack's message retention policies

## üîÑ Alternative: Using Your Slack MCP Server

If you prefer to use your existing MCP server instead of direct Slack API calls, you can modify the API:

```javascript
// Instead of direct Slack API call, use MCP
const mcpResponse = await fetch('http://localhost:3001/mcp/slack/send', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({
        channel: slackChannelId,
        message: conversationSummary,
        blocks: slackBlocks
    })
});
```

This gives you more control and consistency with your existing MCP infrastructure.
